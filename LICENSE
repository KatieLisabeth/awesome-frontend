Creative Commons Legal Code
CC0 1.0 Universal

Creative Commons Corporation is not a law firm and does not provide legal services. Distribution of this document does not create an attorney-client relationship. Creative Commons provides this information on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons makes no warranties regarding the use of this document or the information or works provided hereunder and disclaims liability for any damages resulting from their use.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions automatically confer exclusive copyright and related rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each an "owner") of an original work of authorship or a database (each a "Work").

Certain owners may wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing it to a commons of creative, cultural, and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can use, modify, incorporate into other works, reuse, and redistribute without fear of later claims of infringement. These owners contribute to the Commons to promote a free culture, encourage the production of creative and scientific works, or gain greater distribution and reputation for their Work through its reuse by others.

For these or other reasons, and without expectation of compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent they are the owner of copyright and related rights in the Work, voluntarily applies CC0 to the Work, distributing it under these terms, with full knowledge of their rights and the legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). These rights include, but are not limited to:

i. The right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. Moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. Publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. Rights protecting against unfair competition related to a Work, subject to limitations in paragraph 4(a); v. Rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data in a Work; vi. Database rights (such as those under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and related national implementations); vii. Other similar or equivalent rights throughout the world, based on applicable laws or treaties.

2. Waiver
To the greatest extent permitted by law, the Affirmer irrevocably waives, abandons, and surrenders all Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims or causes of action, whether known or unknown, in the Work, in all territories, for the maximum duration allowed by law, in any medium, for any purpose (including commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes). The Affirmer makes this waiver for the public benefit and intends it to be irrevocable, ensuring the public's ability to use the Work freely, as described in this Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback
If any part of the Waiver is judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, the Waiver will be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Additionally, the Affirmer grants a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable, and unconditional license to exercise the Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. The License applies worldwide, for the maximum duration allowed by law, in any medium, and for any purpose. This License takes effect when CC0 is applied to the Work. If any part of the License is deemed invalid, the Affirmer will not exercise their remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, nor assert any associated claims.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers
a. No trademark or patent rights held by the Affirmer are waived, abandoned, licensed, or affected by this document. b. The Work is offered as-is, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. c. The Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing the rights of others or obtaining necessary consents or permissions that may apply to the Work. d. The Affirmer acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no obligations concerning the use of the Work.
